                Charles Gunther is a New Jersey based wood carver focused on decorative wildfowl sculptures. For over 30 years he has created many carvings depicting waterfowl, birds of prey and song birds.
                <br/><br/>
                Charles has attributed his interest in wildfowl to his childhood exposure to nature and his artistic ability from his father who was an artist in flat work and mixed mediums.
                <br/><br/>
                Formerly a competitor at many competitions including <a href="https://wetlandsinstitute.org/wings-n-water-festival-draws-crowd/">Stone Harborâ€™s Wings and Water Festival</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.wardmuseum.org/SpecialEvents/WorldChampionship">Ward Foundation World Championships</a> in Ocean City, Maryland, Charles has achieved best of division and best of show in open and professional levels of competition.
                <br/><br/>
                Now Charles spends most of his time in the studio creating pieces for commission and personal collections alike.  Every sculpture requires extensive research and interaction with the bird to capture the true essence of the subject. This relationship is a critical element and even led to the creation and maintenance of his personal aviary where he houses several species of North American migratory waterfowl.
